Gauss-Jordan Elimination:
get into row echelon form (all 0s with a single 1 per column)

In row echelon form, columns without leading 1 are free variables. The rest are leading variables. For each column with leading 1's all other elements in the column are 0.

Parallel equations have no solution/are inconsistent.
Overlapping equations have infinite solutions.

When solving using elimination, if false equal statement, e.g. 1 = 2, then system is inconsistent

Can only have 0, 1, or $\infty$ solutions
