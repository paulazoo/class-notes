Components of a matrix = rows x columns

To multiply matrices A(B), columns of A must = rows of B. Components of A(B) = columns of A x rows of B

To do $A \cdot B$, A and B must have same components. $A \cdot B$ = each component multiplied element-wise and added.

1 variable vector = line
2 variable vectors = plane
3 variable vectors = volume/cube

If perpendicular, dot product will = 0
