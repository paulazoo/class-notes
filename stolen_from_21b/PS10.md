### Linear Independence and Subspaces:

linearly dependent vectors $=$ have a nontrivial solution $c_1v_1+c_2v_2+...c_nv_n=0$ (so not all $c$'s $=0$)
- some vectors can be made of a $\mathrm{span}(v_1,v_2,..)$

linearly independent $=$ only 1 solution $=0$ where all $c$'s $=0$)
- none of the vectors can be made from $\mathrm{span}$ of others

subspace V:
1. if $v_1, v_2$ in $V$, then $v_1+v_2$ in $V$ as well
2. if $v$ in $V$, then $kv$ in $V$ as well

$v_1,v_2,...=\mathcal{B}$ of $V$ if:
1. $v_1, v_2, ...$ are linearly independent
2. $\mathrm{span}(v_1, v_2, ...)=V$

### Review stuff:
$A\times B=C\bot$ to both $A$ and $B$

For plane $ax+by+cz=0$, $[a;b;c]=\bot$ vector to plane through $0$
