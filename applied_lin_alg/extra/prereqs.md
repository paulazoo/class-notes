Cofactor matrix:
$\left[{\begin{array}{ccc}
+m & -m & +m \\
-m & +m & -m \\
+m & -m & +m \\
\end{array}}\right]$

always + at top left
m = det of minor

Homogenous Linear Eqs:
system where all eqs = 0
trivial sol = x_1, x_2, x_3, ... all = 0
nontrivial sol = x_1, x_2, x_3, ... not all = 0

Find if has nontrivial sols:
If row-echelon has a non-leading variable (non-1)
So also always if more variables than equations
